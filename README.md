Python Args and Kargs
===================
1) Python args and kargs are used to pass dynamic list of variables to a function
2) https://code.tutsplus.com/articles/understanding-args-and-kwargs-in-python--cms-29494
3) args and kargs are custom keyword and we can use any names but tradiationally "kargs" and "args" are used and easy for other developers identitfy....


self keyword:
============

1) self is keyword which indicates that object itself passed as default argument to a function when  a object is intialized outside of a class
2) self keyword can be in any name  but tradiationally this is the name used to commonly to store a object 
3) once the variables are stored in the object as intance variables it can be used throught class as self.variable=value rather just a variable=value inside the class function

__init__
========
1) __init__ is used default to intialize the object (kind of constructor but technically it is not constructor since constructor (say in c++)  should create and intialize by a function with same name of class ) but whereas in python object is created by when you intialize instance and passed to a function or __init__ function which intialize the object with some variables
2) in python everything is an object so there is no concept constructing an object
