Snake case
===========
Piece of code from a module of the Linux kernel, which uses snake case for identifiers.
Snake case (or snake_case) is the practice of writing compound words or phrases in which the elements are separated with one underscore character (_) and no spaces, with each element's initial letter usually lowercased within the compound and the first letter either upper or lower caseâ€”as in "foo_bar" and "Hello_world". It is commonly used in computer code for variable names, and function names, and sometimes computer filenames.[1] At least one study found that readers can recognize snake case values more quickly than camelCase.[2]


Python private variables(just naming convention):
=========================
Python private variables are one which start with single underscore or double underscore and they are consider to be private. 

Python really doesn't consider this as a private variables but it enforces by means of mangling the class names(when "__" double-underscored used).. Using underscores or double underscores in front of variables or function names are considered to be private...

1) _variablename or _functionname (single underscore) is to be private and cannot seen by other classes or nor imported
2) __variablesname or __functionname (double underscore) is to considered to be semi-private and can seen or imported by other classes

ex:
===
class var:
	self.pubvar = "1_public"
	self._private="2_private" #this variable can't be accessed outside or imported outside
	self.__pvriate="3_sem_private" #this can be imported by sub-class inheriting the parent class safely... and 								it also avoid same name conflict if exist both parent class and sub classes 								by joining class names with variable name called mangling....




Python private are called as weak indicators because like in Java it doesn't have "private" type and it allows python programmer to mention via "-" or "--" naming convention.... Hence it is called "just naming convention and weak indicator"

Pyton Mangling:
-==============

Python Mangling means comibining the variables and functions or methods start with double underscore "__" or single underscore "_" with the class names..  see the above semi priavte example....
